**Auto-labelling**

Plain AI will add 1-2 labels automatically to a thread based on its content. To best leverage Plain AI, make sure you’ve already set up [Labels](/labels) (**Settings → Labels**).

**Thread summarization**

As a thread grows over time, a summary of the thread will be added and kept up-to-date so you know what has happened without having to read the full timeline and every message. You can see the summary on the top right of any thread and in Slack notifications.

**\*** All AI features in Plain are opt-in. More information on our use of OpenAI and our data processing policies can be found in our [DPA](https://www.plain.com/legal/dpa).
