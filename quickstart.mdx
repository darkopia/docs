Plain is the support platform for B2B technical teams. Everything you need to help your customers in a modern, fast and opinionated platform.

This quickstart will tell you everything you need to get started and get the most of Plain.

### The basics

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Create a workspace" icon="seedling">
Everything within Plain happens in a Workspace. To create a workspace for your team, sign up at https://app.plain.com and hit **Create a workspace**.

You will be guided through the set-up including [configuring your email](/email). For this you will need to be able to add a few DNS records for your domain.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Set up notifications" icon="bell">
To be notified of new support request, [set up notifications](/notifications).

We recommend as a minimum setting up one shared Slack/Discord channel where new support requests are posted and also setting up personal notifications so you can be notified of new replies and activity on threads you are assigned to.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connect your Linear workspace" icon="link">
  Connecting your Linear workspace to Plain will let you quickly and seemlessly log bugs and feature
  requests without leaving Plain and, later, close the loop with the customer once they've shipped.
</Accordion>

### Add context

To provide support more quickly, get more context into Plain from your own systems.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Add customer cards" icon="address-card">
Customer cards let you show live information from your own systems in Plain. This lets you quickly see key info around who the customer is and their product usage.

[**Set up customer cards**](/customer-cards/)

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Log key events" icon="code">
Events let you log important actions, errors or other events to Plain. This gives you the full picture when helping a customer as to what happened and why.

[**Set up events**](/events/)

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Set up customer groups" icon="user-group">
Customer groups can be used to organize and segment your customers. For example you could organise your customers by their tier “Free”, “Growth, “Enterprise” or use temporary groups to keep track of customers trialing beta features.
