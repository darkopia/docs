title: 'Manual Ingestion Mode'
---

By default, Plain ingests and groups slack messages automatically for you.

However, there are use-cases where certain channels are too noisy and you don't want all messages to go into Plain or you want to have more granular control.

For that purpose, you have the option to enable **Manual Ingestion Mode**. In it, Plain will only ingest the slack threads you designate by specifying an emoji reaction.

You can configure this by going into **`Settings`** > **`Slack`** and selecting `Manual` ingestion mode. You also have the option to specify which emoji reaction you want to use for ingesting slack messages.

Some considerations to have in mind:
 - A message will only be ingested if the emoji is added by a Plain workspace user
 - You need to add the reaction on the channel message, rather than any of the messages in the slack thread
 - Removing the reaction will not delete the thread in Plain. Furthermore, adding it multiple times will not create duplicate threads.
