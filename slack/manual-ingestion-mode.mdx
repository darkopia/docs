title: 'Manual Ingestion Mode'
---

By default, Plain ingests and groups slack messages automatically for you.

However, there are use-cases where certain channels are too noisy and you don't want all the messages to go into Plain.
Or perhaps you want more granular control over which slack threads end up in Plain.

For that purpose, you have the option to enable **Manual Ingestion Mode**. When enabled, Plain will only pick up the slack threads you specify by adding an emoji reaction.

You can configure this by going into **`Settings`** > **`Slack`** and selecting `Manual` ingestion mode. You also have the option to specify which emoji reaction you want to use.

Some considerations to have in mind:

- A message will be added to Plain only if the reaction is by a Plain workspace user
- You need to add the reaction on the channel message, rather than any of the messages in the slack thread
- Removing the reaction will not delete the thread in Plain. Furthermore, adding it multiple times will not create multiple threads.
