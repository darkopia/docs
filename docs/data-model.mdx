---

This page will give you a birds eye view of how Plain is structured. Whether you are using Plain's API or not, this is a quick way to get your bearings.

Within Plain all data belongs to a **Workspace**. Within a workspace you have **Users**, **Customers**, **Threads**, **Labels**, and **Events**.

## Workspace

Everything within Plain happens in a workspace. Typically you will have one workspace like you would in Slack or Discord.

If you want to just try Plain you can make a demo workspace. Demo workspaces have the full functionality of a real workspace but come with a pre-generated support email adress which you can not change. They are also free!

You can also create multiple workspaces if you want a testing environment: e.g. "Acme Staging" and "Acme Production".

## Users

When you use Plain, you are a user. As user you have one or more roles which define what you are allowed to do within Plain.

## Customers

Within Plain you help customers. Each customer has a name ("Grace Hopper"), short name ("Grace") and one email address. Email addresses are unique across all customers.

Customers are created automatically based on inbound comms or can be created programatically using our API. When created via the API customers can also have an `externalId` which lets you correlate them to customers in your own system.

Customers can also belong to one or more customer groups. This let's you organise your customer into logical groups such as "Free-tier", "Enterprise", "Design partner", etc.

## Threads

Threads are the core of Plain's data model and equivalent to tickets or conversations in other support platforms.

Each thread belongs to one customer and has a status which is one of `Todo`, `Done` or `Snoozed`. When you use Plain to help a customer you assign yourself to a thread and then mark the thread as done once you're done helping.

Threads are created automatically by inbound communications or programatically via the API, for example when a contact form is submitted.

Each thread has a timeline. The timeline contains all relevant communication and events as well as a log of all assignment changes etc.

## Labels

Labels are a light-weight way of categorising threads by topic (e.g. bugs, feature requests, demo request etc.). A thread can have one or more labels and each label has a name and an icon that you choose in your settings.

## Events

Events allow you to log important key actions or events within your own product in Plain. When a customer gets in touch, you will see the events you created on the thread's timeline.

Events provide you with additional context of the customer's actions when you are helping them. For example if a customer delets an API key and then reaches out regarding 401 errors, then you immediately know the full context.
