<Warning>
  An important field that might go unnoticed is `isStartOfThread`. This will tell you if this email
  is the first message of a thread or not, which is useful if you want to build some auto-reply
  logic. If you want to build an auto-responder that *only replies* to the first message of a
  thread, please check [`thread.thread_created`](/webhooks/thread-created) instead.
</Warning>
