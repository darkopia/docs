You can reply to a thread using the `replyToThread` mutation. The call to this mutation will be successful if:

- the last message in the thread is an email from the customer OR
- the thread was just created with [`createThread`](/graphql/threads/create)

If it is not possible to reply to this thread, you will get the mutation error code [`cannot_reply_to_thread`](/graphql/error-codes#cannot_reply_to_thread) and a message indicating why.

<Info>
  Using the `replyToThread` mutation is the recommended way to create a simple auto-responder with
  Plain. To do it, you should subscribe to the
  [`thread.thread_created`](/../../webhooks/thread-created) event and use use this mutation whenever
  you get this event.
