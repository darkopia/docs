title: 'Alternate addresses'
---

Within Plain you can configure up to 5 alternate email addresses. Alternate email addresses allow you to receive and send emails from Plain just like your main support email address.

You can configure these at the bottom of **Settings** â†’ **Email** page in Plain.

Alternate email addresses must:

- Have the same domain as the main. E.g. if you main support email is help@acme.com then you could have hello@acme.com as an alternate addresses but not sales@tnt.com.
- Be forwarded in the same way as your main help email to the email address Plain provides you when setting up your email.

Once alternate emails are set up you can choose to reply from them when writing an email in Plain. By default Plain will always try to reply with the same email used by the customer.
