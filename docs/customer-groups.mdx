Customer groups can be used to organize and segment your customers. For example you could organise your customers by their tier "Free", "Growth, "Enterprise" or use temporary groups to keep track of customers trialing beta features.

You can configure the groups in your workspace by going to **Settings** â†’ **Customer Groups** where you can set a name and color per group.

You can then either manually add a customer to a group from any thread or you can programatically [via the API](/docs/api-reference/graphql/customers/customer-groups).

You can also filter threads by customer groups so you can for example prioritise threads belonging to Enterprise customers.
