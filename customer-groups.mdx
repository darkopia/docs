A common use-case is to segment customers by their tier (e.g. "Free", "Growth", "Enterprise") or use temporary groups to keep track of customers trialing beta features.

You can configure the groups in your workspace by going to **Settings** â†’ **Customer Groups**, where you can set a name and color per group.

You can then either manually add a customer to a group from any thread, or you can programmatically [via the API](/api-reference/graphql/customers/customer-groups).

You can also filter threads by customer groups, so you can, for example, prioritize threads belonging to Enterprise customers.
