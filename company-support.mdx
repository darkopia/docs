<Frame>![Company support within Plain](/public/images/companies-introduction.png)</Frame>

In Plain you can see what company a customer belongs to, so you have more context when providing support.

The company is automatically set based on the email domain of the customer and is visible throughout the support app.

You can also see all of your open threads by company in the left hand sidebar and filter by company in any queue using the shortcut **F** or the filter button top right.
